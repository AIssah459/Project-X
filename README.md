# Project X

Full-stack webapp froject for my portfolio

The frontend was written with React + Vite + Bootstrap

The backend was written with NodeJS + Express, connected to a MongoDB database for authentication and data retrieval

#### The link for my backend source code is: https://github.com/AIssah459/Project-X-API

So far it only works locally because of CORS reasons, need to find somewhere to host bost the frontend and the backend on the same domain for free :(

## Features

You can sign up, login, post events, view your feed, edit events, delete events, and view user profiles. All these features depend on a MongoDB database, which would need to be created to run locally unfortunately (can't share my connection string)
